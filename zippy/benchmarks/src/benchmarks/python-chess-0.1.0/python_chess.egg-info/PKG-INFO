        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is the scholars mate in python-chess:
        
        ::
        
            board = chess.Bitboard()
            board.push_san("e4")
            board.push_san("e5")
            board.push_san("Qh5")
            board.push_san("Nc6")
            board.push_san("Bc4")
            board.push_san("Nf6")
            board.push_san("Qxf7")
            assert board.is_checkmate()

        Features
        --------
        
        * Legal move generator and move validation. This includes all castling
          rules and en-passant captures.
        
          ::
        
              assert not chess.Move.from_uci("a8a1") in board.legal_moves
        
        * Detects checkmates, stalemates and draws by insufficient material.
          Has a half-move clock.
        
          ::
        
              assert not board.is_stalemate()
              assert not board.is_insufficient_material()
              assert board.is_game_over()
        
        * Detects checks and attacks.
        
          ::
        
              assert board.is_check()
              assert board.is_attacked_by(chess.WHITE, chess.E8)
        
        * Parses and creates SAN representation of moves.
        
          ::
        
              board = chess.Bitboard()
              assert "e4" == board.san(chess.Move(chess.E2, chess.E4))
        
        * Parses and creates FENs.
        
          ::
        
              assert board.fen() == "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
              board = chess.Bitboard("8/8/8/2k5/4K3/8/8/8 w - - 4 45")
              assert board.piece_at(chess.C5) == chess.Piece.from_symbol("k")
        
        * Parses and creates EPDs.
        
          ::
        
              assert board.epd(bm=chess.Move.from_uci("d2d4")) == "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - bm d4"
        
              ops = board.set_epd("1k1r4/pp1b1R2/3q2pp/4p3/2B5/4Q3/PPP2B2/2K5 b - - bm Qd1+; id \"BK.01\";")
              assert ops["id"] == "BK.01"
              assert ops["bm"] == chess.Move(chess.D6, chess.D1)
        
        * Read Polyglot opening books.
        
          ::
        
              import chess.polyglot
        
              with chess.polyglot.open_reader("data/opening-books/performance.bin") as book:
                  board = chess.Bitboard()
        
                  for entry in book.get_entries_for_position(board):
                       assert chess.Move.from_uci("e2e4") == entry.move()
                       break
        
        Peformance
        ----------
        python-chess is not intended to be used by serious chess engines where
        performance is critical. The goal is rather to create a simple and relatively
        highlevel library.
        
        However, even though bit fiddling in Python is not as fast as in C or C++,
        the current version is still much faster than previous attempts including
        the naive x88 move generation from libchess.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        * With pip:
        
          ::
        
              sudo pip install python-chess
        
        * From current source code:
        
          ::
        
              python setup.py build
              sudo python setup.py install
