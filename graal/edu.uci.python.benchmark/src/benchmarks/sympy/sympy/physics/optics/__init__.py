__all__ = []

# The following pattern is used below for importing sub-modules:
#
# 1. "from foo import *".  This imports all the names from foo.__all__ into
#    this module. But, this does not put those names into the __all__ of
#    this module. This enables "from sympy.physics.optics import TWave" to
#    work.
# 2. "import foo; __all__.extend(foo.__all__)". This adds all the names in
#    foo.__all__ to the __all__ of this module. The names in __all__
#    determine which names are imported when
#    "from sympy.physics.optics import *" is done.

from . import waves
from .waves import TWave
__all__.extend(waves.__all__)
