# ZipPy #

ZipPy is a fast and lightweight [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) implementation built using the [Truffle framework](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal/). ZipPy leverages the underlying Java JIT compiler and compiles Python programs to highly optimized machine code at runtime.

ZipPy is currently maintained by [Secure Systems and Software Laboratory](https://ssllab.org) at the â€‹[University of California, Irvine](http://www.uci.edu/).
